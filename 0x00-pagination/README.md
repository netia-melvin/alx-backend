HATEOAS

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
2. How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
3. How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

**Requirements**

1. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
2. All your files should end with a new line
3. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
5. Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
6. The length of your files will be tested using wc
7. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
8. All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
9. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
10. All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
